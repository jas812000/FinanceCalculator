/**
 * The {@code TaxTableCalculator} class calculates the federal income tax for individuals,
 * heads of household, married couples (filing jointly or separately), and estates/trusts
 * based on their filing status and gross income for the 2025 tax year.
 * <p>
 * This calculator uses inflation-adjusted tax brackets and rates as published in the IRS
 * Revenue Procedure for taxable years beginning in 2025. The class supports the following
 * filing statuses:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Unmarried Individuals</li>
 *     <li>Heads of Household</li>
 *     <li>Married Individuals Filing Separately</li>
 *     <li>Married Individuals Filing Jointly or Surviving Spouses</li>
 *     <li>Estates and Trusts</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class encapsulates logic to determine the applicable tax rate and calculate the
 * federal income tax using the correct thresholds and rates according to the taxpayer's
 * status and income level.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: This class reflects the tax brackets and rules effective as of October 22, 2024,
 * and applicable to the 2025 tax year per the IRS Revenue Procedure. If the tax code is
 * amended after that date, results may not reflect subsequent changes.
